# DemoiOSApp-NYT
Sample iOS assignment to list New York Times Articles. Provided options to see articles based on **Most Viewed, Most Searched & Most Emailed**. Also provided an option to **search the articles**.

I have used **MVVM architecture** to create this project. This application works in **Portait mode**. I have also written a few **Unit testcases**.

You can download and run project directly. No third party libraries used.
